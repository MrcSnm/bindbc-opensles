# BindBC-OpenSLES

The reasoning on this project is to generate a D binding to OpenSLES, an audio library for embedded systems.

It is using [bindbc-generator](https://www.github.com/MrcSnm/bindbc-generator) for bind automation.
Initially, I plan to use bindbc-generator as a starting point for this project, later, I could do some plugin for its generation.
The current main target for this project is to execute it on Android.
